# A-Portable-Lightweight-UVM-Testbench-Framework
This repository demonstrates a clean, lightweight, and portable UVM testbench architecture designed to run on free simulators such as ModelSim Lattice Edition. The goal is to show how to build a structured, scalable UVM environment without unnecessary complexity, DPI dependencies, or simulator-specific features.
